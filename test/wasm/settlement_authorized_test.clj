  authorized check (`settlement-amount-exceeds-authorized-violations` in
  src/card/governor.cljc, backed by `card.registry/settlement-amount-
  exceeds-authorized?`) runs as a real WASM guest, not just as JVM
  Clojure.

  ABI: main is 0-arity (kotoba wasm emit rejects a parameterized main --
  :main-arity); the two real i32 inputs are written into the guest's
  exported linear memory at fixed offsets before calling main() -- see
  wasm/settlement_authorized.kotoba's ns docstring for the offset
  layout."
